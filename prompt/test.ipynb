    "John Smith: Good morning, everyone. Let's get started. Today, we are going to discuss the progress on the new feature rollout and review the timelines for the upcoming sprint. Sarah, can you start by giving us an update on the development?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sarah Johnson: Sure, John. The development team has finished coding the core functionalities, and we're now in the testing phase. We encountered a minor issue with the API integration, but we're working on a fix and should be ready by tomorrow. \n",
    "\n",
    "John Smith: That sounds good. Do you anticipate any delays because of this issue?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sarah Johnson: No, it is a straightforward fix. We do not expect it to affect the overall timeline.\n",
    "John Smith: Great. Alex, could you share your findings on the data analysis for the user behavior metrics?\n",
    "Alex Brown: Absolutely. Our analysis showed a significant increase in user engagement after implementing the recent UI changes. The average session duration went up by 15%, and the bounce rate decreased by 8%. We still need to validate these results with more data, but it looks promising.\n",
    "John Smith: Those numbers are encouraging. Maria, are there any design changes based on Alex's findings?\n",
    "Maria Lopez: Yes, we are considering a few adjustments to make the interface more intuitive, especially in the navigation menu. We’ll be doing some A/B testing to confirm which version works best.\n",
    "John Smith: Excellent. Michael, how is the QA testing progressing?\n",
    "Michael White: Testing is going well. We've identified a few bugs in the beta version, mainly related to form validation. The team is already addressing them, and we’re planning to run another round of testing next week to ensure everything is resolved.\n",
    "John Smith: Good to hear. It looks like we are on track. Let us aim to finalize the testing by the end of next week so we can move forward with the release. Any other items we need to cover?\n",
    "Sarah Johnson: Just a quick reminder—we have a code review scheduled for tomorrow at 2 PM. It would be great if everyone could attend.\n",
    "John Smith: Thanks, Sarah. If there are no other updates, we will wrap up here. Great work, everyone. Let us keep up the momentum!\n",
